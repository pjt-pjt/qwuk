### Credits where credits are due:

#### Quake
    Code portions use from the complete source code for winquake, glquake, quakeworld, and glquakeworld.

    The code is all licensed under the terms of the GPL (gnu public license).  
    You should read the entire license, but the gist of it is that you can do 
    anything you want with the code, including sell your new version.  The catch 
    is that if you distribute new binary versions, you are required to make the 
    entire source code available for free to everyone.
